# 001 Azure Subnet Peering

* Aim: illustrate subnet peering in the MSFT Azure public cloud.

## Architecture

![snet_peering_architecture](images/az_001_subnet_peering.png)

* The hub virtual network, `VNET-HUB-UKS-001`, contains an IIS server, `vmiiscore-uks-001`, that can communicate with x2 vms in peered subnets in virutal network, `VNET-SPOKE-UKS-001`.
  * Illustrated by the green subnet peering lines in the center of the architectural diagram.
* Subnet peering is established between `snet-iiscore-frontend`, and `snet-sql-backend` and `snet-integration-backend` respectivley.
* The highly sensitive HSM workload in subnet `snet-hsm-backend` is intentionally isolated â€” subnet peering is not established between it and `snet-iiscore-frontend`, preventing any communication with the IIS server.
* Access between peered subnets is further restricted using network security groups `nsg-hub-uks-001` and `nsg-spokes-uks-001`. Enforcing least privilege and east-west traffic control.

## Deployment 

* Authenticate to azure and set the subscription context
  * `az login`
  * `az account set -s <your subscription id>`
  * `az account show`
* Within directory `tfm_iac\` run terraform commands workflow:
  * `terraform init`
  * `terraform plan -out snet_peering.tfplan` 
  * `terraform apply -auto-approve ".\snet_peering.tfplan"`
* Test accessing the iis frontend server: 
  * `http://192.168.5.4`
  * `curl http://192.168.5.4`
* Review subnet peering details using the Azure CLI: 
```
az network vnet peering show `
  --resource-group "RG-ZIMCANIT-SNETPEERING-DMO-UKS-001" `
  --vnet-name "VNET-HUB-UKS-001" `
  --name "vnet-hub-uks-001--to--vnet-spoke-uks-001" `
  --output json > vnet_hub_peering_info.txt
```
  * Within file: `vnet_hub_peering_info.txt`, review attributes such as `localSubnetNames`, `remoteSubnetNames`, `localVirtualNetworkAddressSpace` and `remoteVirtualNetworkAddressSpace` to validate peering configuration.

## Resource destruction 

* Within directory `tfm_iac\` run the terraform command: `terraform destroy -auto-approve`
* Logout of azure: `az logout`
